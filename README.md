# QML-TicTacToe
TicTacToe game.

## Build instructions

To build this project you need [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) >= 5.11 and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.1. You should be able to build it using QtCreator without any issues.

## Features

This game is an extended version of the classic [TicTacToe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game. You can play on field of any size between 2 to 5 rows and colunms.  

You can use keyboard to play it as well as the mouse. Arrow keys move around the board and enter makes the move  

You can play both against yourself or the computer opponent. The opponent uses min-max algorithm to determine next move. The algorithm is not very optimized at the moment, so it takes a lot of time on the 5x5 board to move.
